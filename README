Let me preface by saying this is not perfect. 

Enter the command <make> to compile and enter command <./oss> to run. 

Enter the command <make clean> to remove executables, .o files and the log. 

Sometimes when you run it, it will immediately get stuck and not output anything to log file. Just try running it again, it works on the second or third 
time. 

Also, for some reason, the code will never fully terminate. Oss gets stuck on a msgrcv but I don't know how to make it not wait for a message if there
are no messages. 

Another thing, at the end of the code, the last few forks fail, so some children processes must not be fully terminating. 

I do not have command line arguments for max processes, but rather I have a constant integer named MAX_PROCESSES in oss that sets the max processes.
It is currently set to 18. I haven't tried running this with anything other than 18.
